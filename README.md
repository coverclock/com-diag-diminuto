Yeah, the directory structure here is all hosed up. I made some minor (I thought) tweaks to how I was using
"git svn" with my legacy SVN repository and as a result everything ended up in a subdirectory. D'oh! I'm going
to fix it, but I need to think about how I want to do this since it actually affects every project I'm hosting
at GitHub. My bad! Worse: I'm busy with a paying gig and am only working on this today because it's the July
Fourth holiday in the U.S. and Mrs. Overclock (a.k.a. Dr. Overclock, Medicine Woman) has to work.
