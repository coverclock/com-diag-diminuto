This directory contains some source code that I thought might be useful
someday - or maybe not. Most of this was originally created to store some
ideas that came to me while working with very small PIC microcontrollers,
the smallest of which has a read/write memory store of a mere ninety-six
bytes (that's bytes, not kilobytes, or any other *bytes).
