 * @brief Implements a Red-Black tree.
 * @author Chip Overclock <mailto:coverclock@diag.com>
 * @see Diminuto <https://github.com/coverclock/com-diag-diminuto>
 * @details
 *
 * The Tree feature implements a Red-Black Tree. This is intended to be used
 * to build more complex data structures, such as those that have
 * associative-memory-like properties. See diminuto_store and its unit test
 * for a more complete solution.
 *
 * I looked at all of the references below, but the one I found the most useful
 * was the one from the U-Boot boot loader, which is a simplified version of the
 * implementation in the Linux kernel. This implementation is inspired by the
 * U-Boot code, even though it looks nothing like it. Since I wanted this to be
 * a kind of reference implementation for my own use, I didn't make it as time
 * or space efficient as the the implementations in U-Boot or the Linux Kernel.

 * the same tree will always point to the same root), and a pointer to a
 * payload (which may or may not be used, or may containing something other
 * than a pointer). This structure has a lot of wasted space. The Linux
 * implementation (from which U-Boot borrows) uses a trick I've used myself in
 * the past: hide the color bit in the otherwise unused lowest order bit of one
 * of the pointers. The down side is that you now have an invalid pointer value
 * that you have to deal with. I chose not to do that for this code since my
