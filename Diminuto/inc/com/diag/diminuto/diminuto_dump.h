 * This facility was inspired by countless dump programs I have encountered
 * over the years on platforms like the IBM 360 and the PDP-11. Depending on
 * what you're doing, you might want to try diminuto_phex_emit() instead,
 * particularly if you are dumping data byte by byte from a real-time source
 * like a serial port. On the other hand, if your data is in a buffer or is
 * structured, this approach is probably better.

/**
 * Dumps a block of memory in hexadecimal along with printable characters.
 * The hexadecimal and character portions of the dump are both done in network
 * byte order (big-endian), with addresses increasing from left to right. This
 * makes multi-byte fields on little-endian systems look a little weird as
 * bytes are swapped. This function is ridiculously customizable; much easier
 * to use one of the macros like diminuto_dump(), diminuto_dump_virtual(),
 * or diminuto_dump_bytes().
 * @param fp points to the file stream to which to dump.
 * @param data points to the data to dump.
 * @param length is the size of data to dump in bytes.
 * @param upper if true dumps in uppercase hex else lowercase hex.
 * @param dot is the character to substitute for unprintable characters.
 * @param virtualize if true cause the next parameter to be printed as the
 * address instead of the actual address.
 * @param address is used as the replacement address to be printed.
 * @param indent causes each line to be indented by this many spaces.
 * @param bpw is the number of bytes per word.
 * @param wpl is the number of words per line.
 * @param addrsep points to a string that separates address and first word.
 * @param wordsep points to a string that separates words.
 * @param charsep points to a string that separates last word from characters.
 * @param byteskip is a character printed when there are no bytes.
 * @param charskip is a character printed when there are no characters.
 * @param lineend points to to a string that ends each line.
