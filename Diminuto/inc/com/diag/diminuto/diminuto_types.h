 * next 16bits/2bytes/1short is are ones, and the final 32bits/4bytes/2shorts
 * contain the IPv4 address. The following IPv4-in-IPv6 representations of the
 * IPv4 address 192.168.1.222 are all equivalent:
 * "0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:FFFF:192.168.1.222", ":::::FFFF:192.168.1.222",
 * "::FFFF:192.168.1.222" [RFC4291]. This is a struct instead of an array
 * type (which do in fact exist) because structs can be passed by value to
